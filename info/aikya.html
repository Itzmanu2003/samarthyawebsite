    <p>
      AIKYA was the fruitful result of the collaborative effort of a five-member team- Prerana, Pramitha Dsouza, Simone Dsouza, Sinchana B R and Sweekrithi K S constantly guided by their mentors, Mr. Glenson Toney and Mr. Aldrin C Vaz. Their main focus was to address the alarming maternal mortality rate amongst pregnant women. The team chose AIKYA for the name since it means “to walk together” which symbolises the work carried out by the team.<br/>

They developed a predictive model utilizing machine learning, considering general factors and existing health conditions such as BMI, heart rate, age and blood sugar. Their vision extensively extended into the development of a user-friendly app which could predict if a pregnant woman could be at risk of complications in the future by using her body parameters such as age, heartbeat, blood pressure etc. If a patient was deemed at low risk based on the factors provided, the app would suggest tailored exercises and dietary plans. For those in the mid-risk category, virtual consultations with the concerned doctor could be scheduled through the app. In cases of high risk, an immediate SOS alert would be sent to the family and the patient could opt to book an ambulance.
The technical intricacies of their project involved the implementation of various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, among others. They assessed the accuracy of each algorithm and selected the one that yielded the highest accuracy.<br/>

<h3>AIKYA bagged the first place in the business plan contest, Ingenious-2023 conducted by Business Administration of SJEC.</h3>
