   <p>Team AMIE consisting of A Spoorthi, Ishika, Jenisha D'Souza of the E&C 
    department from SJEC along with Shravya and Pooja from St Raymond's High School developed a 
    predictive model that anticipates pregnancy health risks in women. It advanced an IoT wearable device
     3d printed at the SJEC-AICTE IDEA lab capable of collecting necessary information regarding the 
     pregnant women. The details taken into account are blood pressure, sugar level, heartbeat, sleep 
     cycle, BMI including the medical history to predict potential health risks. This model is followed 
     by the development of an app which instigates the identification of all the above-mentioned health 
     parameters. The app also makes way for the patients to get in touch with the doctors/ gynecologists
      by booking an appointment online. In cases of high risk, the app leverages a way for the patient
       to get quick access to healthcare facilities at the earliest.</p>
