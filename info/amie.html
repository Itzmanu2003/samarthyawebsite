    <p>
      Team AMIE consisting of A Spoorthi, Ishika, Jenisha D'Souza of the E&C department from SJEC along with Shravya and Pooja from St Raymond's High School developed a predictive model that anticipates pregnancy health risks in women<br/>

     It advanced an IoT wearable device 3d printed at the SJEC-AICTE IDEA lab capable of collecting necessary information regarding the pregnant women. The details taken into account are blood pressure, sugar level, heartbeat, sleep cycle, BMI including the medical history to predict potential health risks. This model is followed by the development of an app which instigates the identification of all the above-mentioned health parameters. The app also makes way for the patients to get in touch with the doctors/ gynecologists by booking an appointment online. In cases of high risk, the app leverages a way for the patient to get quick access to healthcare facilities at the earliest<br/>

<h3>Team AMIE found their ways through competition to be placed under top 5, at the fourth position in the Karnataka Edition of Anveshana 2023! In addition to this the team also won a cash prize of INR 15000.</h3>
